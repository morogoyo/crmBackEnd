## Project title
This is the proposed back end to a CRM (Customer Relationship Management system) 


## Motivation
Here in Florida the economy is driven by service workers or busineses that render services, I figured that I can come up with a version that isnt too complicated and had basic functionality to keep the many mom and pop shops around town in touch with their customers. I understand that there are many other CRM's in the market but ..... I am not re-inventing the wheel I am just trying to simplify it.



## Installation

Download the repository and run from the command line


## How to use?

Since this is still a back end project there are no view, so all work  will have to be seen in either postman or swagger

Endpoint Documentation will be at this address
localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html
